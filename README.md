GuydoshLab code for deep sequencing analysis



This code was used by the Guydosh Lab for analysis of S. cerevisiae ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq data. This code was uploaded on April 6, 2020. It requires Python2, BioPython, and BCBio for GFF parsing.

Prior to upload of this code, the Guydosh lab often provided code to other labs. That code contains a fair bit more complexity for performing other sorts of analysis whereas the code here is limited to functions used in published work.

This code under continual development and updates will be posted here.

On November 4, 2023, a new version of this code was uploaded (version 1.13g). Note that the original version remains and is referred to as version 1.07bg.

The runscripts folder contains wrapper functions for calling the core code.
